## Exporting emissions to other models

Emissions are mass that affects atmosphere in complex ways, not only physical,
but also, in the health of humans, ecosystems, economically, etc.

There are several models whose inputs are emissions, such as [R-Line](https://www.cmascenter.org/r-line/) or [WRF-Chem](https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/).

This R-Package provide functions to read emissions from [VEIN](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa/vein) and also other 
in different formats and export the to format suitable to other models.

The first case itof this package will be with the model R-Line.
